# Dual-Turing node: what was measured, and what was only predicted

Nothing in this file may state a performance number that a real request did not
produce. Predictions are labelled as predictions until a measurement replaces
them. "Allocates", "starts" and "works at length" are three different claims and
only the third one counts.

## Multi-GPU defect ledger

A second card exposed a whole family of defects in tooling that had only ever
run on one. All of them shared one shape: read `nvidia-smi`, keep the first row,
treat it as the machine's answer.

| site | field | what it did on two 11 GiB cards |
|---|---|---|
| `select-quant.py` `detect_memory_mib` | `memory.total` | reported 11264 MiB and concluded no quantisation fits |
| `serve-profile.sh:48` (llama.cpp) | `memory.free` | refused to start: ~11000 free against a 20000 floor |
| `serve-profile.sh:107` (vLLM) | `memory.free` | same |
| `measure-ceiling.sh:48, :229` | `free`, `used` | would have measured the ceiling against half the VRAM |
| `measure-slot-frontier.sh:90` | `memory.free` | would have priced a seat against half the VRAM |
| `bench-context-sweep.sh:45` | `memory.free` | same |
| `install-node.sh:53` | `memory.total` | reported half the card capacity during provisioning |
| `setup-linux-qwen38.sh:42` | `memory.total` | same |

Two `head -1` reads were **left alone deliberately**:
`setup-linux-qwen38.sh:40` (`driver_version`) and `:41` (`name`). Every card on a
host shares one driver, and the first card's name is the key convention
`gpu-registry.json` uses.

**Why the fix is not "subtract more headroom".** The per-card cost — compute
buffers plus the CUDA context — is charged by scaling the existing
`--reserve-mib`, not by shrinking the detected budget. Doing both double-counts
headroom and silently costs a whole rung of context; this project has made that
mistake once already. One device leaves the reserve untouched, so the 24 GiB
node's measured numbers do not move.

**The aggregate is not always the right bound.** A model *pinned* to one card is
limited by the smallest card, not by the sum — 22 GiB across two cards does not
hold a 16 GiB model that may not be split. `per_card_ceiling()` and
`vram-guard.sh --min-per-card` exist for exactly that case.

## Host cleanup — before

_Filled by Task 5 Step 1._

## Host cleanup — after

_Filled by Task 6 Step 7._

## Reboot: what it proved

_Filled by Task 7 Step 5 — kernel, driver, both cards, topology, NVLink presence._

## Model switch cost

_Filled by Task 12 Step 7._

## Measured throughput and verified ceilings

_Filled by Task 13. Until then the only figures available are roofline
predictions at the project's calibrated 0.8 efficiency: ~30 tok/s for the 27B at
UD-Q4_K_M and ~87 tok/s for the 9B at Q4_K_M, from 616 GB/s per card._
